Supybot-Soccer
==============

Supybot plugin for soccer / futbol scores, lineups, tables and fixtures.

I started this as just a way to display some scores from the major leagues and
got a ton of requests to expand it.

Main commands:

    - soccer <league/tournament> - display scores from a league like EPL or tournament like UCL.
    - soccerlineup <team> - tries to locate a line-up (if posted) for a team on match day.
    - soccertable <league> - displays a league's table.
    - soccerstats <stat> <league> - displays leaders for things like goals, assists, fairplay and cards.
